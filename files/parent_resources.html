            Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
            individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s
            interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides
            a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and
            independence in all developmental areas. The philosophy of the
            nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play.
            Our approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are
            learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than
            the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to
            interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them.
            For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the
            interests and abilities of the children in the classroom. In
            addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
            science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
            education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would
            be enriching for our program.

            The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and
            nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary
            to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time
            as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our
            rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends
            safe, and the toys at school safe. The staff is trained to
            anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children
            of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In
            most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something
            negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured
            party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then,
            they will turn their attention to the child who might need more
            support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping
            their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred
            will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things
            with the peer. Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our
            discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own
            actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children
            learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate
            behavior. This is done through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
            <li>
              Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially
              positive activities.
            </li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings</li>
            <li>
              Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and
              constructive manner.
            </li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will
            work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate
            recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding
            and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that
            we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is
            determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool
            experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with
            parents at which it may be decided that this program is not
            appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make
            recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community
            services if parents so desire.

          <p>
            Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These
            three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school
            day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3
            parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit
            should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located
            off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is
            $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide
            validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special
            school events.

          <br />
          <p>
            It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are
            comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and
            outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing
            appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should
            be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as
            outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the
            winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will
            usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill
            taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent
            marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
