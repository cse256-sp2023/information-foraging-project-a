          Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
          individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
          and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
          nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
          developmental areas.

          The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
          effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
          act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
          more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
          children to interact with their environment in ways that are
          meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
          reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
          In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
          science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
          education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
          enriching for our program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
          and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
          individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
          her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
          growing community of children, families and teachers.

              Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
              Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
              each month and build understanding through conversations and
              experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
              home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
              of Art.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at
              WUNS since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion
              for the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am
              reminded and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and
              sincerity of each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of
              Art from their personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your
              Preschooler with me!

              I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
              year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
              taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
              teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and
              directed a variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute
              professionally, but I have greatly missed the special energy that
              lights up when I share music and movement with young children, who
              have an innate desire to make playful noise and wiggle their
              bodies. I am very excited to share that joy with all the bears at
              WUNS…including my own little boy who is a Big Bear and Sun Bear.

              Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
              songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
              children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
              classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only
              our voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use
              percussion instruments and props like scarves that help us
              visualize the beats we create. All of our repertoire will give us
              the opportunity to explore tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and
              expressiveness, and all will be fun!

            <p>
              I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish
              enrichment program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is
              to keep it fun, simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song,
              props, games or movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and
              simple phrases in memorable ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes
              for songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will
              list the vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or
              an overview of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will
              circle back to certain lessons throughout the year for review and
              recall.

              I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that
              has been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to
              preserve our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of
              our society to love and respect the natural world around them.
              Nature on the Move allows children to get up close to Missouri’s
              wildlife and learn how each living thing affects the world in
              which they live. I will visit WUNS once per month with a lively
              presentation on a variety of topics.
